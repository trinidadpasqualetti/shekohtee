                            <p> It's a short book but I read it in literally two days because I was so enthralled and surprised at how much films have changed the story. Nothing against the films, they're great, but they seem to focus so much on how the monster was created and make him into this lumbering brain dead zombie. The novel on the other hand is so much deeper---I love how the monster is intellectually curious and able to ask things like who am I? What am I? Why am I? The monster learns, is elequent, able to appreciat. Grandad was the one who told us. He'd been out with Sally for one of their walks through the New Forest. Supposed to be gone until late afternoon, but he came back early. Sally didn't. I was in the lounge when I heard the hammering on the front door. Loud, panicked. It was lunchtime and I was sat in front of the TV, watching Netflix. I paused the show and went to answer it. It took me a moment to recognise grandad. Normally he's this calm, gentle giant. He combs what's 
I was there when Russo Brothers attended a QampA after showing at Smithsonian Air amp Space Museum (https://twitter.com/KevinMcCarthyTV/status/1123577380684083202) in Washington DC last night. It was an hour-long spoiler discussion that lasted to \~11 PM. Half of the audience has already seen the movie before showing. The discussion went very well. The directors talked a lot on their approach and their experience filming Endgame, less on the story itself though. amp#x200B; https. Their theory about Steve returning to Peggy is conflicting to the explanation shared by Joe Russo since according to them, Steve lived with Peggy in the prime timeline. Full interview : https://www.fandango.com/amp/movie-news/exclusive-interview-the-avengers-endgame-writers-break-down-the-biggest-moments-in-the-movie-spoilers-753736 Fandango: Let's start with the time travel. What was your approach? Stephen McFeely: Okay, so we always like writing ourselves into corners "Around, around, the merry-go-round. Three steps to the left, three taps on the ground. Three steps to the right, and don’t make a sound. Because if you fall in, you won’t like what you’ve found.” My mother’s eyes. Liquid, flaming pools of derision. She would stare at me as she recited the miserable phrase to me nightly, her twisted, drug addled perception of a lullaby. When I was three, the words barely registered. When I was five, the words soothed, because I didn’t understand them. Going through old issues of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter and posting highlights in my own words.

In the last Monthly Rage Thread, i saw user BlueIsForPlayers say something i have personally thought and many others i've seen express about the character designs in Fire Emblem Three Houses, these designs, especially the hair, look kinda. off (https://old.reddit.com/r/fireemblem/comments/bj79bg/monthly_rage_thread/em5u7yw/) (Excuse the caps, it was the rage thread) This lead to me looking up some of the past work from character designer, Chinatsu Kurahana (Who used to go under anther Please comment which one you are interested in.

I can’t believe this. This is a tragedy. A travesty. I have followed ASOIAF for 30000000 years and what was the point? Why did I spend so many hours neglecting my marriage and family to read overthought fan theories about Tyrion being the actual NK and Sansa marrying The Hound? The only way, out of all the hundreds of ways it could have logically gone, was obviously Jon murdering Dany because Bran warged into him and said “do it, fam, lol” (this is 10000% in line with Jon’s character.

There are many celebrations; but Phedre notices that Hyacinthe is not his old partying self. The assemblage fetes all the way back to the City of Elua. At one point, Phedre asks Hyacinthe about what will happen to the time-honored occupation of strait mastering. Will you take an apprentice? “You lookin’ for a job?” Hyacinthe aks. “No. This is a continuation thread in an effort to summarize all the Foreshadowing and Callbacks from each episode, feel free to point out anything that might be missing it will be added into the post! amp#x200B; There will be a minor difference in this post which i will instead delve a little into each character in this episode as well. Also as always at the end of the post i share some final thoughts on the entire episode. (Special shout out to Starbucks for sponsoring this episode) amp#x200. Following up on /u/0rrery's post (https://www.reddit.com/r/LOONA/comments/bh39ko/190425_10asia_feature_eng_loona_we_want_to_be_a/) on the 10asia cover story, here's the full interview with Loona that they published in the magazine. A slightly abridged version is available here (https://entertain.naver.com/read?oid=312ampaid=0000384436) online; the print version in this Tweet stream (https://twitter.com/Akwoo_jiM/status/1121251970755379201) has some additional questions and answers. Hector and I were released from the hospital after a few hours (https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/awp7yg/my_fried_chickenloving_demon_roommate_is_back_in/). After doctors made sure that absolutely nothing was wrong with us, they reluctantly sent us on our way- even though this situation logically made no sense. The force of the car crash would have killed us easily. Mom drove us back and rambled on and on about how glad she was that we were okay, and how much of a miracle </p>
