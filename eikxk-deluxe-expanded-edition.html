                            <p> If you listen with headphones, you can faintly hear ozzy in the background. This is a greatly-expanded version of an essay I first posted back in February 2016. If you read the original, I think it's worth taking a look at the whole thing anyway, as I've made revisions throughout. The intro is heavily revised and Lyanna's Locket is new. Everything from "Barristan vs. King's Landing; Jorah vs. Barristan vs. The Titan's Bastard" onward is new. In between, there are only a couple new things/revisions.  This is long, but it's very quote-heavy after the intro. 
Also readable on my blogspot, HERE (https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2018/12/20/ser-byron-the-beauty-and-the-beast-sandor-clegane/). This writing is the long-promised follow-up to the second post in my trilogy about Ser Byron amp Tyrek Lannister (https://www.reddit.com/r/asoiaf/comments/63masy/spoilers_extended_littlefingers_third_knight_ser/), which argued that we seemingly have Every. Reason. In. The. World. to believe that Ser Byron The Beautiful, one of a trio of hedge knights. You can also read this on my blog (https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/). Warning: This analysis assumes that one of ASOIAF's main themes is the instability and inscrutability of identity and the difficulty of recognition. I've written about this HERE (https://asongoficeandtootles.wordpress.com/2017/03/23/recognition-and-the-seeming-difficulty-thereof-in-asoiaf-deluxe-expanded-edition/). Have a look if you dislike the idea of "secret identities" in ASOIAF beyond those that are already. ___ King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard - Murder of the Universe (https://f4.bcbits.com/img/a3406870115_10.jpg) Label: Flightless, ATO Genre: Psychedelic Rock, Spoken Word, Garage Rock Vince Staples - Big Fish Theory (https://www.tinymixtapes.com/sites/default/files/1705/07a34a35ce7a1e865a8bc0418fb0caf6.1000x1000x1.jpg) Label: Def Jam Genre: West Coast Hip Hop, Experimental Hip Hop Algiers - The Underside of Power (http://images.genius.com/9a4caacaa1a7177707d6ae533859def. Just finished watching the DVD of the concert included in the Deluxe Expanded Edition and let me say this.WTF Warner Bros? It looks like they burned a disc off my 30 year old VHS tape. Of all the money they've made off Purple Rain, Prince, and his fans, you'd think they could have remastered one of the greatest concerts in history. They could have filmed interviews with the band to talk about the show, or the tour, or found Prince superfans with memorabilia collections, or a thousand different. Because the sub is a little slow these days, I thought this might be fun to discuss: As we all know, mewithoutYou has an extensive and varied catalogue, spanning six full length albums, several EPs, deluxe/expanded editions, and a bunch of b-sides, covers, and more. They are always changing and evolving their sound. Out of everything they've ever released, what two songs would you say are the most dissimilar? I love pitting the polar opposite songs against each other to remind myself how divers. 3/7 Massemord - Devil Black metal Shepherd - Stereolithic Riffalocalypse Stoner metal Unveiled - Endless Extreme Hate Brutal death metal Dream of the Damned - Chronicles (Demo) Depressive black metal 3/8 Tenggorokan - Execution of Death Brutal death metal Blacksoul Seraphim - Hymns for the Vanquished Doom/Gothic metal 3/9 Deathhammer - Evil Power Thrash metal Gouge - Beyond Death Death metal Les Chants de Nihil - Armor Black metal. Posted this in another r/, and had a couple people misunderstand or just straight ignore my explanation and tell me not to buy a book. I hope this works, because I really don't want to buy a book and regret it. And because thats all anyone seemed to care about before, NO I do not plan to follow the book word for word, and I DO understand that its an open world exploration game that isn't meant to have a set path. I get it. I just bought my switch, and I really want a book as a companion piece. secretly canadian has announced (https://secretlycanadian.com/record/love-work-the-lioness-sessions/) songs: ohia "love and work- the lioness sessions" for release on november 23rd. it'll be a deluxe 2xlp with an entire LP of unreleased recordings, a sixteen page booklet and tons of related ephemera including a reproductions of jason's 'two of hearts' totem card, a letter he wrote to his future wife, and the postcard that served as the album's cover. there's a virtual unboxing video (https:/.
